### Examples of pyspark with Jupyter notebooks

In this project you will find some `pyspark` examples performing simple tasks, exposed within Jupyter notebooks. In order to execute them, I used the `docker` container that `start.sh` runs. 

However, the project is purely for demonstration purposes and does not contain any of the resources from which the computation was carried out.

I plan to extend It with more example of what `pyspark` makes possible do.
